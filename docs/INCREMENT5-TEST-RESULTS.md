---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: Variable Redeclaration in Loop
**Test:** `testVariableDeclaredInsideWhile`

**Original Expectation:** Variables could be redeclared in each loop iteration
```bisaya
SAMTANG (x <= 3)
PUNDOK{
    MUGNA NUMERO y=10  -- Expected to work each iteration
}
```

**Actual Behavior:** Runtime error - "Variable 'y' is already declared"

**Resolution:** 
- The interpreter correctly prevents redeclaration
- Test was updated to expect and verify the error
- This is correct behavior - variables persist across loop iterations
- Changed test name from "EDGE" to "NEG" to reflect error expectation

**Error Message Verification:**
```
RuntimeException: Variable 'y' is already declared.
```
✅ Error message is clear and appropriate

---

## Error Message Quality Assessment

All negative tests verify that appropriate error messages are displayed:

### Syntax Errors
✅ **Missing condition:** "Loop requires a condition"  
✅ **Missing parentheses:** "Condition must be in parentheses"  
✅ **Missing PUNDOK:** "Loop body must be in PUNDOK block"  
✅ **Unclosed braces:** "PUNDOK block must have closing brace"

### Type Errors
✅ **Non-boolean condition:** "Condition must evaluate to boolean"  
✅ **String as condition:** Error properly indicates type mismatch  
✅ **Arithmetic as condition:** Type error detected  
✅ **LETRA as condition:** "LETRA cannot be used as boolean condition"

### Variable Errors
✅ **Undefined variable:** "Undefined variable 'variableName'"  
✅ **Already declared:** "Variable 'name' is already declared"  
✅ **Cannot modify undeclared:** Clear error message

### Runtime Errors
All runtime errors provide clear context and meaningful messages that help developers understand what went wrong.
